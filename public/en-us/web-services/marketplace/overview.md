# Overview

mod.io supports the management of player-owned entitlements on first party platforms for use within the mod.io eco-system. Multiple methods are available for integrating, and subsequently converting first party entitlement purchases into mod.io Virtual Currency Packs. The implementation option chosen should factor in the needs of your studio and if your organization has existing systems setup for handling In-App Purchases against first-party platforms or whether you want mod.io to assume responsibility for doing so.

The purpose of this documentation, is to explain how to run your own [Purchase Server](/web-services/marketplace/studio-as-purchase-server/) to convert first party entitlement purchases into mod.io Virtual Currency Packs. If you want to read how to setup and use the mod.io Monetization functionality, [detailed documentation](/monetization/) can be found here.
