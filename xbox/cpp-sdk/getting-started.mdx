## Installing the GDK Platform Modules

To use the mod.io GDK integration, you need to copy the "gdk" directory into the platform subdirectory of your SDK installation.
You can then target GDK_XSX or GDK_XBONE to compile the mod.io SDK for GDK. 

## GDK Versions

The mod.io SDK is built and tested against GDK version March 2023 Update 2 (20230302). Using different versions of the GDK may result in compilation issues.

## Initializing the mod.io SDK

You should also ensure that you are passing Modio::Portal::XboxLive to InitializeAsyncâ€™s PortalInUse property. This adds support for XBL usernames for linked accounts to be returned when querying mods, which is a certification requirement when displaying UGC.

## Using the XBox Module

In order for the mod.io SDK to initialize on an XBox, you must ensure that PersistentLocalStorage is enabled and a static storage value. We recommend only allocating as much as you need, such as 2048mb.

```
  <PersistentLocalStorage>
    <SizeMB>2048</SizeMB>
  </PersistentLocalStorage>
```
