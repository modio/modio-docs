The Template UI is a working, fully featured mod browser.

It can act as a reference for experienced engineers to review when implementing the Components into their own UI, or it can be used as a functional template right off the shelf for developers who don't have the time/resources to build their own Mod Browser. 

It's designed to be a user friendly interface that can handle all the base functions required in a Mod Browser for Console and PC. It's visual design is clean and minimal, and it's built to be flexible enough for developers to easily modify to suit their needs.
