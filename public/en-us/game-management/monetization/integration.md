# Integration

The mod.io official plugins for Unreal Engine and Unity are the easiest way to integrate the Marketplace in your game. Please follow the guides in the relevant link for your game engine.

* [SDK Guide](/cppsdk/marketplace/)
* [Unreal Guide](/unreal/marketplace/)
* [Unity Guide](/unity/marketplace/)

:::note
If selling the mod.io virtual currency through a platform store, you will need a service to consume the virtual currency entitlements and apply them to player's mod.io account.
See [Purchase Server Implementation](/web-services/marketplace/overview/) for more information
