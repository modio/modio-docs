# Component UI for Unity

Component UI is the backbone of any [in-game UI](https://docs.mod.io/in-game-ui/) you may want to implement for UGC and can be completely customized to suit your brand and game.

## UI framework for Unity

Component UI is a live, fully functioning feature within the [Unity Plugin](/unity). 

:::note[WIP Documentation]
Full documentation for this is currently being developed.

### Explore components with Template UI

Component UI is essentially a collection of parts that you can utilize to create in-game UI. The best way to learn what is available for the Unity Plugin is to explore [Template UI](/unity/template-ui/integration), which is a fully featured UGC browser built using Component UI.

By tweaking the prefabs and components of Template UI, you'll be able to better understand what is available to you. If you would like assistance or to learn more about Component UI within the Unity Plugin, don't hesitate to contact us at developers@mod.io.
