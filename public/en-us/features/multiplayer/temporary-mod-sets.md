# Temporary Mod Sets

Temporary Mod Sets allow for UGC to be identified and downloaded even if the player doesn't own that piece of UGC, with the ability to automatically delete any unowned UGC after the session ends. This is incredibly helpful for multiplayer play sessions in general, but especially when UGC purchases via [Marketplace](/monetization/marketplace) come into play.

## Compatibility 

The Temporary Mod Sets feature is compatible with all our mod.io plugins and SDKs. You can find the specific documentation below:
