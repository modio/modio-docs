# Overview

When interacting with [mod.io](https://mod.io/) you may wish to use your own managed identity provider for mod.io interaction by your players. To facilitate this functionality, mod.io offers two widely-used complementing OAuth flows for account linking across both game clients and traditional web-based OAuth flows.

## Supported Use Cases

| **Origin of Authentication** | **Recommended Flow**                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| In-game                      | OpenID                                      |
| Embeddable ModHub            | OpenID or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow |
| mod.io Website               | OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow           |

mod.io recommends that unless you require the ability to use your own identity provider, you should default to using our first party authentication options such as Steam, Xbox Live, PlayStation&trade;Network, etc. which are flows supported both in-game and via our official website. Studio authentication is considered an advanced feature for studios that wish to develop and support their own identity provider.
