## Authentication sample

Inside folder `platform/gdk/examples/Authentication` there is sample code that uses `Modio::AuthenticateUserExternalAsync` with `Modio::AuthenticationProvider::XboxLive` as the authentication provider, performing SSO with mod.io via an Xbox Live token for the currently logged-in user. You will need to provide a `Modio::GameID` and a `Modio::ApiKey`, as well as an SCID, at the top of the `main.cpp` file.

For more details, follow the general details described in the https://github.com/modio/modio-sdk[mod.io repository]
