# Marketplace

## Overview

The mod.io SDK supports in-game integration of the mod.io Marketplace - exposing the data and functions required to build a UGC store in-game.

The mod.io monetization features are need to be enabled through the web UI and, if selling the virtual currency through a platform store, will need a service to consume the virtual currency entitlements and apply them to player's mod.io account.
