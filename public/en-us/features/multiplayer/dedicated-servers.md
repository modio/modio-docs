# Dedicated Servers

If your game is oriented towards online play, mod.io ensures players can join and play on a wide range of modded (and unmodded) servers and games without the need for any setup beyond being authenticated.

## Streamlining server types

When using UGC, there are generally two forms of online multiplayer: dedicated servers, and P2P sessions, each with their own unique requirements and considerations. 

* **Dedicated servers:** A dedicated server needs to be able to download UGC packages, update them where needed, and propagate their information to players joining the game, and those players can in turn have their own UGC (cosmetics etc) which the server will need to identify and relay to all other players. 
* **P2P servers:** While P2P servers do not need to maintain a persistent list of UGC, they do still need to ensure joining clients can quickly and easily acquire the required UGC to play together successfully. 

This feature aims to solve these issues in a seamless and pain-free manner for developers, server hosts, and players alike.
