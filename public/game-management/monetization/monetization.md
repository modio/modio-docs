2. [Request Monetization](/monetization/enabling), by visiting game admin > monetization -> getting started, and we will enable the Marketplace for you.
3. Refer to the [Getting Started guide](/monetization/getting-started/) to learn how to integrate the Marketplace into your game.
4. Complete the [technical integration](/monetization/integration) using the official mod.io plugins or REST API
5. Use mod.io as a [purchasing server](/web-services/marketplace/overview) or create your own
