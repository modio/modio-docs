The mod.io official plugins for Unreal Engine and Unity are the easiest way to integrate the Marketplace in your game. Please follow the guides in the relevant link for your game engine.

:::note
If selling the mod.io virtual currency through a platform store, you will need a service to consume the virtual currency entitlements and apply them to player's mod.io account.
