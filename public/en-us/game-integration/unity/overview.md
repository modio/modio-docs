It handles all of the common tasks, allowing game developers to quickly and easily implement a solution that enables players to access and discover user-generated content for their games.

:::note  
A custom-built [ready-made UI](#quick-start) for mod discovery is included, along with installation and collection management, and a full-featured [C# interface](#getting-started) which connects to the [mod.io REST API](https://docs.mod.io).
