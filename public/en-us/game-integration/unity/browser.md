# UGC Browser

The mod.io Unity Engine plugin comes with a configurable in-game UGC browser.  

:::warning 
> The Browser UI relies on the *config file* that is configured during the [setup instructions](/unity/setup). Ensure you have completed all of those steps before proceeding.
:::

The Browser UI is incredibly simple to set up, and completely avoids the complexity that can come with building a full-featured mod browser: 

1. Drag the Browser UI prefab at `Assets/Plugins/mod.io/UI/Examples/ModIOBrowser` into your scene.
2. Call its `ModIOBrowser.Browser.Open()` method to show the browser in your scene.

If you want a fuller understanding of the plugin and its features, we recommend following the [getting started guide](/unity/getting-started).

:::tip
If you dont wish to use the UI it is safe to delete the UI folder located at Assets/Plugins/mod.io/UI
