## Authentication sample

Inside folder `platform/nx/examples/Authentication` there is a sample code that uses `Modio::AuthenticateUserExternalAsync` with `Modio::AuthenticationProvider::Switch` as the backend that provides the base token to authenticate with the mod.io service. You will need to provide a `Modio::GameID` and a `Modio::ApiKey` to the top of the `main.cpp` file.

You must register the `Nintendo GameID` (0x....) in mod.io. You can do that in `Game Settings -> Authentications -> Nintendo Switch App ID``

For more details, follow the general details described in the [mod.io repository](https://github.com/modio/modio-sdk)
