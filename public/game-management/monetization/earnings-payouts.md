# Earnings and Payouts

## Token Conversion

Any earnings received as part of a sale of premium UGC transactions will be earned as tokens. Tokens received are held
for 30 days from the time of transaction, this is to account for any potential refund. If a piece of content was
purchased on external platforms, then Tokens are held until the [Invoice is paid](/monetization/invoices) by the studio or publisher.

Once tokens are available, you are able to convert these tokens to your USD wallet through your Game Admin Dashboard (if
you onboarded via KYB) or through your Account (if you onboarded via KYC).

Tokens convert at a fixed rate of USD$0.004 per token as explained in [How it Works](/monetization/how-it-works). Once a token is
converted to USD it
will be available to be paid out from your account.

## Payouts

If you have onboarded your game through KYB, any funds marked as available in your USD wallet will be paid out
automatically every month via wire transfer by our payment partner, Tilia.

A representative from Tilia will reach out to the Financial Contact marked in your Monetization Settings to obtain the
information needed.

You will be able to see your balance at any time through your Game Admin dashboard on mod.io.

If you have onboarded your game through KYC, you will be able to see your balance through your Account on mod.io.
