## Why include UGC?

User-generated content and modding have been a staple of the games industry for some time. It's a way of fostering community, connecting passionate players and discovering new and exciting ways to play.

For some games, UGC has helped extend the overall lifespan, for others, it's unlocked new possibilities inside the gamespace. UGC can be a powerful tool that adds more personal and customized journeys in an already interactive medium.

## mod.io for studios

mod.io provides a seamless experience for you and your users, making it easy for creators to upload (and players to download) UGC for your game. No two games are the same, which is why we offer a variety of different tools, plugins and solutions to help tailor our service to your needs.
