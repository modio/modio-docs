# mod.io Unity Plugin

The mod.io Unity Engine plugin is the simplest and fastest way to integrate UGC into your Unity **2020.3+** game. It handles all of the common tasks, allowing game developers to quickly and easily implement a solution that enables players to access and discover user-generated content for their games.

A custom built [ready-made UI](/unity/ugc-browser) for UGC discovery is included, along with installation and collection management, and a full-featured C# interface which connects to the [mod.io REST API](https://docs.mod.io/restapiref/).
