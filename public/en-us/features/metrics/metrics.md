# Overall
The metrics dashboards provide game studios with end-to-end visibility into their UGC ecosystem. Each dashboard highlights key activity, performance trends, and user engagement, making it easier to track growth, identify issues, and optimise your UGC strategy.

Dashboards combine at-a-glance metric tiles with detailed drill-down views, allowing both quick monitoring and deep analysis.
At the top of each dashboard is a row of spark charts showing the total numbers of each stat presented in that dashboard. Click on each spark chart to populate the dashboard with the chosen stat. For example, to see month-on-month growth for ‘UGC added’, click on the ‘UGC added’ spark chart, then scroll down to view the ‘Monthly growth’ chart.
