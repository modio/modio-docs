import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Documentation for each component in the mod.io UI framework contains the following sections:

* **Implementation  Requirements**  
  This section specifies any requirements that a widget must meet in order to be considered a component by the mod.io UI. The mod.io framework does not impose a specific base class on widgets; the primary requirements for each component will be specified in terms of the interfaces a widget should implement.

* **Default Component Implementations**  
  This section contains a number of sub-sections providing information that is specific to the default implementation of a given component provided by mod.io. These should be treated as implementation details from the perspective of widgets or components that consume the widget in question.

  * **Additional Interfaces**  
  This is a list of any interfaces that this particular default component implementation uses in addition to the standard implementation requirements for this component.  For example, the **Icon Button** implements all the standard interfaces of the **Button** (`IModioUIClickableWidget`, `IModioUISelectableWidget` etc.), plus the `IModioUIImageDisplayWidget` interface to display an icon.

  * **Properties**  
  This is a list of editable configuration properties that the default component implementation exposes. These properties are configurable on instances of the component, but runtime changes should be performed through the relevant interface instead.

  * **Sub-components**  
    Some components may have sub-components (for example, the default **Button** implementation provides a **Label** sub-component). This section outlines:
  
    - The getter function that's used to retrieve a reference to the sub-component in question
    - A description of the sub-component, including the type or expected interfaces that it needs to implement and how the sub-component is used in the default component implementation

  * **Event Data**  
    Components will expose interface functions for adding event handlers for various events that the component will emit. This section outlines what those events are and the data that is passed by the default implementation to delegates that are bound to those event handlers.


## UI Component Specifications


### Button

The button component is a base component in the mod.io Component UI framework. It implements interfaces to support data binding as well as click, selection and hover events.


#### Implementation Requirements

A `UWidget`-derived class must implement the following interfaces to meet the requirements of a Button Component:

|Required Interface|Purpose|
|-|-|

#### ModioCommandMenu 

The Command Menu is a default implementation of the Command Menu component which uses an internal sub-component implementing IModioUIObjectSelector to display a set of commands to users and allow them to select one.

#### ModioObjectWrapBox 

The Object Wrap Box is a default implementation of the Object List component. This implementation derives from `UWrapBox` and defers to it for visualizing a set of objects.

#### ModioPopupCommandMenu 

The Popup Command Menu is a default implementation of the Command Menu component which is intended as an abstract base class for a widget that manages an internal sub-component that can be shown and dismissed based on user input. This base class provides an overridable function to construct the internal menu sub-component that will be displayed on request, and handles forwarding IModioUICommandMenu messages to that widget. Derived classes should provide an implementation of ConstructCommandMenuWidget, and their own custom behaviour for showing and dismissing that widget instance.

###### Inheritance Hierarchy
-> ModioUIComponentBase-> CommonActivatableWidget-> CommonUserWidget-> UserWidget-> Widget-> Visual-> Object






##### Get Command Menu Widget

Provides a reference to the internal widget that displays the command menu

##### Construct Command Menu Widget

Implement this function to construct the actual command menu widget that will be displayed and dismissed /// on user input. Implementing classes are responsible for holding onto this internal sub-component so it is not /// garbage collected.
