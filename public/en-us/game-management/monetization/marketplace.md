# Marketplace

When Marketplace is enabled, a Marketplace tab will appear on your mod.io game profile. This will list all UGC that has been approved for sale.

As a studio you will have the ability to subscribe to all paid UGC automatically, or purchase it directly to support creators.

## Refunds

Players will be able to self-service refund any transactions they have made through their Account on mod.io, with some restrictions detailed below.

- **Virtual Currency Packs** - Players can request a refund for any unused virtual currency packs they have purchased via the mod.io website within 30 days of purchase. If they've used any part of the credits purchased, it won't be eligible for a refund. One virtual currency pack refund request is available automatically every year. If they've purchased virtual currency packs through other platforms (ex: Steam, Microsoft Store, PlayStation™Store), they’ll need to request a refund through the relevant platform, and follow their own refund policy.

- **Premium UGC** - Players can refund a premium UGC purchase via the mod.io website within 7 days of purchase. Up to eight refunds of premium UGC purchases are available automatically every year.

The studio will also be able to refund transactions on behalf of the player if the transaction has been made within 30 days.
