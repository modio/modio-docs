# Data

Your game's data is shown on dashboards on mod.io. To access the dashboards, click the ‘stats’ icon at the top right of the game page on the mod.io website. Alternatively, access the url ‘https://mod.io/g/gamename/admin/stats’, substituting ‘gamename’ in the url. You will first see the UGC dashboard. Other dashboards can be accessed via the ‘Stats’ dropdown at the top of the game admin menu. 

At the top of each dashboard is a row of spark charts showing the total numbers of each stat presented in that dashboard. Click on each spark chart to populate the dashboard with the chosen stat. For example, to see month-on-month growth for ‘UGC added’, click on the ‘UGC added’ spark chart, then scroll down to view the ‘Monthly growth’ chart.
