### Inside a CMake project

1. Unzip the archive
2. Confirm `your_project` uses CMake 3.20 or later

   ```cmake
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
   ```
3. Specify the target platform with options: PROSPERO

   ```cmake
   set (MODIO_PLATFORM Prospero)
   ```
4. Add the SDK subdirectory to your project

   ```cmake
   add_subdirectory(<modio-sdk folder> EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
   target_compile_features(your_project PUBLIC cxx_std_17)
   ```
5. Link the library to your project

   * To use the header-only configuration:

     ```cmake
     target_link_libraries(your_project PUBLIC modio)
     ```
   * Or to use the static library configuration:

     ```cmake
     target_link_libraries(your_project PUBLIC modioStatic)
     ```

To simplify the CMake configuration, the folder platform/prospero/cmake has the file "CMakePresets.json" with the base configuration required to guide the mod.io SDK compilation using the PS5&reg; SDK. If you copy that file to the folder root, it can be used as follows:

```cmake
cmake --preset prospero
```
