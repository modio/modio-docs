# Setup

Once you've gained access to the Embeddable Hub, you'll find the settings in your game's Admin Dashboard. When you navigate to the page, you'll be prompted to set up a hub with a name and some basic styling. After you've saved your changes, your hub will be created and you can now explore the rest of the configurable options as well as preview your hub.
