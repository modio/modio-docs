# Apple Authentication

Typical requirements for using mod.io on Apple games include:
* A method for moderating objectionable material from being made available
* A mechanism to report offensive content and timely responses to concerns
* The ability to block abusive users from the service
* Published contact information so users can easily reach you
* An Apple developer account

## Setting up Apple SSO

This guide will show you how to setup authentication to mod.io using Apple SSO for their players on Apple devices.

### Sign in players to mod.io using Apple

If your game is using the official mod.io SDK, Unreal or Unity plugin, follow the instructions provided with it to authenticate players using Apple SSO, or other supported platform authentication methods.

* For the C++ SDK, [click here](/cppsdk/getting-started/#ssoexternal-authentication)
* For Unreal Engine, [click here](/unreal/getting-started/user-authentication#single-sign-on-authentication)
* For Unity Engine, [click here](/unity/getting-started/#authentication)

If you are building something custom using the mod.io REST API, follow the [instructions provided here](https://docs.mod.io/restapiref/#apple) to authenticate players using Apple SSO, by calling the `/external/appleauth` endpoint.
