You can export all the data sent to each dashboard by clicking the ‘Export all’ button at the top right. This will download a zip file of CSVs containing the daily and monthly data for each metric. This export is not dependent on what is currently being shown on the dashboards. 

For example, if you have ‘Downloads’ loaded into the UGC data, the ‘Export all’ button will also export data for each other primary metric. Likewise, if you have the monthly graph zoomed into the past three months, the export zip will contain monthly data for all the months your game has been on mod.io. 

In future, you will be able to export data directly to the BI software of your choice, as a premium feature.
