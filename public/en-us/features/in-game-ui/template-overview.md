# Template UI

Template UI is a fully featured in-game UGC browser that's built using Component UI.

![in-game ui overview](img/template.png)

## Pre-built UGC browser for mod.io plugins 

Template UI is designed to be a user-friendly interface that can handle all the base functions required from a UGC browser for console and PC. Its visual design is clean and minimal, and can be customized and tweaked to suit your needs. 

It serves two main purposes: 

1. It can be used as a functional template right off the shelf if you are looking for a ready-made solution. 
2. It can act as a reference for when you are implementing components into their own UI.
