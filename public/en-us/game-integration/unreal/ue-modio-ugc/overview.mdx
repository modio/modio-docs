# ModioUGC

**ModioUGC** (along with **ModioUGC Editor**) is a module specifically for our Unreal Engine Plugin that facilitates UGC creation, packaging, and runtime loading for Unreal Engine projects. It provides an opinionated framework for treating User-Generated Content as content-only plugins, solving the complex challenges of cooking, mounting, and discovering UGC at runtime.

This guide covers:

* [What's included](#whats-included)
* [UGC in Unreal Engine](#ugc-in-unreal-engine)
* [How ModioUGC works](#how-modiougc-works)
* [Next steps](#next-steps)

## What's included

ModioUGC provides tools and systems for the complete UGC lifecycle:

* **Editor Wizard**: Create standardized content-only plugin structures for UGC packages
* **Packaging Tools**: Cook and package UGC content as DLC plugins for target platforms
* **Runtime Subsystem**: Automatically discover, mount, and register UGC packages at runtime (as well as unmount and unregister)
* **Asset Registry Integration**: Seamlessly integrate UGC assets with Unreal's Asset Registry and Asset Manager for discovery and querying
* **Provider System**: Flexible interfaces for sourcing UGC from mod.io, local directories, or custom sources
* **IoStore Support**: Full compatibility with both traditional PAK files and modern IoStore (`.ucas`/`.utoc`) formats

## UGC in Unreal Engine

Supporting User-Generated Content in Unreal Engine presents several significant technical challenges that ModioUGC is designed to address.

### Cooking

Unreal Engine's asset cooking process converts raw uassets into platform-specific formats optimized for runtime performance. This poses challenges within a UGC context:

- **Platform specificity**: Assets must be cooked for each target platform (Windows, consoles, mobile)
- **Engine/Game version matching**: UGC must be cooked with the exact engine and release version of the game
- **Content isolation**: UGC should not duplicate base game assets, but must correctly reference them
- **Metadata preservation**: Information about assets must be preserved through the cooking process to allow for stable runtime discovery

### Mounting

Loading packaged content at runtime requires integration with Unreal's file system:

- **PAK file mounting**: `.pak` files must be mounted to the virtual file system at specific mount points
- **Editor complexity**: Iterating on a UGC integration in the editor is complex due to a difference in how assets are managed in editor vs cooked builds
- **Shader compatibility**: Material shader libraries must be compatible between the base game and UGC

### Discovery

Once UGC is mounted, the game must be able to query and use the content:

- **Asset Registry population**: Mounted assets must be registered with Unreal's Asset Registry
- **Asset Manager integration**: Content should be discoverable through standard `UAssetManager` queries
- **Sandboxed Storage**: The system must be able to load UGC from any file directory on the system
- **Dynamic updates**: The system must handle UGC being added or removed while the game is running

## How ModioUGC works

ModioUGC addresses these challenges through a structured, plugin-based architecture.

### UGC as content-only plugins

Rather than handling loose asset files, ModioUGC treats each piece of UGC as a self-contained **Content-Only Plugin**:

```
MyModPlugin/
├── MyModPlugin.uplugin       # Plugin descriptor
└── Content/
    └── Paks/
        └── Windows/
            ├── MyModPlugin-Windows.pak    # Cooked content
            ├── MyModPlugin-Windows.ucas   # (if IoStore enabled)
            └── MyModPlugin-Windows.utoc   # (if IoStore enabled)
```

This approach provides several benefits:

- **Isolation**: Each UGC package is independent with its own content directory
- **Native engine support**: Unreal Engine already understands plugin loading and lifecycle
- **Metadata storage**: The `.uplugin` file provides a standard location for version, author, and dependency information
- **Dependency management**: Plugins can declare dependencies on other plugins or the base game

### The ModioUGC pipeline

The plugin provides tools for each stage of the UGC lifecycle:

#### 1. Creation (Editor Tools)

The **UGC Plugin Wizard** generates the correct folder structure and files:
- Creates a content-only plugin with proper `.uplugin` settings
- Generates the required `UUGC_Metadata` data asset for Asset Manager integration
- Sets up the plugin for explicit loading (required for proper unloading at runtime)

#### 2. Packaging (ModioUGCPackager)

The **UGC Packager** wraps Unreal's `RunUAT` automation tool to cook content as DLC:
- Ensures only UGC plugin content is cooked (not base game assets)
- Handles platform-specific cooking arguments automatically
- Supports both traditional PAK and modern IoStore workflows
- Corrects `.uplugin` metadata post-packaging for proper runtime behavior

#### 3. Runtime Loading (UGC Subsystem)

The `UUGCSubsystem` manages UGC discovery and loading:
- **Provider Pattern**: Uses `IUGCProvider` interface to locate UGC packages
  - `UModioUGCProvider`: Discovers UGC installed via the mod.io plugin
  - `USideLoadUGCProvider`: Loads UGC from a local directory (useful for testing)
- **Automatic Discovery**: Scans provider paths for valid `.uplugin` files
- **PAK Mounting**: Handles low-level mounting of `.pak`/`.ucas`/`.utoc` files
- **Asset Registration**: Populates Unreal's Asset Registry (and optionally Asset Manager) with mounted content
- **Lifecycle Management**: Supports mounting, unmounting, and refreshing UGC at runtime

### Accessing UGC content

Once the subsystem has mounted UGC, content becomes available through standard Unreal APIs:

```cpp
// Query all maps (including those from UGC)
UAssetManager& AssetManager = UAssetManager::Get();
TArray<FPrimaryAssetId> MapIds;
AssetManager.GetPrimaryAssetIdList(FPrimaryAssetType("Map"), MapIds);
```

UGC assets are treated as first-class content, indistinguishable from built-in game assets.
