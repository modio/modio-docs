# Unity Legacy Plugin

The [mod.io Legacy Unity Engine plugin](https://github.com/modio/modio-unity/releases/tag/v2025.2) is the simplest and fastest way to integrate UGC into your Unity **2020.3+** game. It handles all of the common tasks, providing a foundational solution that enables players to access and discover user-generated content for their games.

A custom built ready-made UI for UGC discovery is included, along with installation and collection management, and a full-featured C# interface which connects to the [mod.io REST API](/restapi).
