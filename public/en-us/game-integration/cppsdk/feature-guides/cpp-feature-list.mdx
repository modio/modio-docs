# List of Features
The C++ SDK is compatible with a variety of mod.io's features. These are additions to the core functions that are designed to streamline and elevate your game's UGC. 

Recommended process:

* **Core Functions**: Work through the [C++ SDK Getting Started Guides](/cppsdk/#c-sdk-core-setup-guides) to fully integrate the core functionality of the SDK.
* **Features**: Explore the [Features section](/features) to find what suits your game. 
* **Features Setup Guides**: Use the below setup guides to implement your chosen features. These are split into: 
    * [C++ SDK specific](#c-sdk-specific): Features that require configuration within the C++ SDK. 
    * [Additional features](#additional-features): Features that work alongside the C++ SDK but are configured elsewhere.
