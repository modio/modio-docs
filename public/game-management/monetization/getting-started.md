The mod.io Marketplace allows content creators to monetize premium UGC (User-Generated Content) in-game, on any platform, to a worldwide audience, generating new sources of revenue for game studios and content creators. This guide is designed for game studios and publishers pursuing Marketplace as a service offering for their game.

### Flexible and customizable

Studios define how revenue is split with their content creators. You have control to adjust to a model that works best for you and your community.

### White label solution

You can customize things to fit your game and brand (such as the name and amounts of tokens your players will purchase to buy UGC from your marketplace). 

### Secured and scalable 

Backed by a KYC/KYB verification process for all users and businesses, our system is entirely PSD2, PCI, and sales tax compliant, supporting payments in 180 countries. All regulatory obligations are managed through Tilia, our digital payment solution, ensuring a secure end-to-end payment with built-in fraud detection.

### Full Control 

As a studio or publisher, you control the conditions for content to be sold on your Marketplace. Our Partner Program allows you to decide which creators in your community are able to monetize within your game. And your game admin dashboard gives a wide range of controls, metrics, and critical insights; allowing you to configure and optimize the creator economy for your game.

The mod.io Marketplace is currently accessible through invitation only. You can dive into the guide below for a walkthrough of the system's inner workings.
