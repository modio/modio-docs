# Dashboard

Once you’ve onboarded you should see new menu options in your mod.io Game Admin, in the Marketplace section. 

## Dashboard

Your dashboard will show a snapshot of your Marketplace economy including a summary of your sales and earnings for the past month and year, as well as the most recent transactions.

## Settings
    - **Marketplace** - You will be able to adjust the settings you configured as part of your onboarding here. These are the same controls and options you enabled in [Monetization settings](/monetization/onboarding#monetization-settings).
    - **Manage SKUs** - You will be able to enable and disable any token packs sold on the Marketplace here. These are the same [Token Packs](/monetization/onboarding#token-packs) set up during onboarding. Please note that you will need to adjust any configurations of SKUs on external platforms to ensure compatibility.
    - **Partner Program** - Direct access to the configuration of [Partner Program](/monetization/onboarding#partner-program) settings can be found here.
    - **Financial Contact Info**  - If you wish to update or change the assigned Financial Contact, you can access these details at any time. We will use this information to send any invoices owing.
    - **In-App Purchases** - To enable cross-platform functionality for Marketplace purchases, it's essential to configure your available platforms. Enter your API keys and pertinent details for these platforms in this section.

## Transactions
    - **Transactions** - This section enables you to review all transactions carried out on the game marketplace. You can apply filters to distinguish between SKU sales and UGC sales, or delve into individual transactions to examine the revenue trail and, if applicable, process refunds for eligible transactions.
    - **Invoices** - A full visible list of all pending and historical invoices can be viewed in this section. Full details of how Invoices function can be seen [here](/monetization/invoices).

## Entity Team (KYB only)

You will have the ability to define who, from your game team on mod.io, will have full access to functions such as payouts, transaction details, and history. You will be able to adjust this at any time in this section.

## Revenue Share (KYC only)

One of the benefits of the Monetization system is the ability to specify what portion of funds go to each individual member of your game team. This means if you have it set as receiving 60% as part of the revenue then at the time of transaction you will automatically receive 60% of the game team’s share of that transaction automatically to your own personal wallet.
