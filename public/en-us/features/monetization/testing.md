# Monetization Testing

Before going live, you can set up a test environment to explore our [Monetization](/monetization) features and ensure they work as intended.

This guide covers: 

* [Setting up a test environment](#setting-up-a-test-environment)
* [Payment testing](#payment-testing)

## Setting up a test environment

If you wish to explore the [Marketplace](/monetization/marketplace) functionality ahead of implementing the real thing, you can do so by following the below steps:

1. Access the test environment at https://test.mod.io and create a game.
2. [Request Marketplace](/monetization/enabling), by visiting game admin > monetization -> getting started, and we will enable the Marketplace for you.

## Payment testing

To assist with testing our [Monetization](/monetization) features, you can use these testing card numbers. Testing cards should only be used in the test environment, as real cards will not work inside this environment.
