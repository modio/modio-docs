# Health Metrics

The Health dashboard reports four data sources:

* UGC reports opened
* UGC reports closed
* UGC deleted
* User reports opened

## UGC Reports Opened

‘UGC reports opened’ shows the total number of reports that have been opened against UGC in your game. These reports are broken down into the following types:

* DMCA
* Not working
* Illegal content
* Auto Virus
* False information
* Rude content 
* Stolen content
* Generic
* Other

## UGC Reports Closed

‘UGC reports closed’ shows the total number of reports that have been closed for your game, either by your moderation team or by mod.io. Like ‘UGC reports opened’ they are broken down into the report types. If you have an active moderation team, this metric should track very closely to ‘UGC reports opened’. 

## UGC Deleted

‘UGC deleted’ shows the total number of UGC that have been deleted in your game. The difference between this metric and ‘UGC reports closed’ can suggest whether you are getting valid reports. For example, if you have many more reports closed than UGC deleted, this suggests that the reports are spurious, since valid reports will most often lead to deleted UGC. 

## User Reports Opened

‘User reports opened’ shows the total number of reports made against users in your game. Like ‘UGC reports opened’, this has dimensions of the different report types that can be made against users.
