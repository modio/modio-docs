# Overview

mod.io supports the management of player-owned entitlements on first party platforms for use within the mod.io eco-system. Multiple methods are available for integrating, and subsequently converting first party entitlement purchases into mod.io Virtual Tokens. The implementation option chosen should factor in the needs of your studio and if your organization has existing systems setup for handling In-App Purchases against first-party platforms or whether you want mod.io to assume responsibility for doing so.

# Implementation Options

#### Glossary

- **Platform**: A first party platform, such as Steam, Xbox Live, PlayStation&trade;Network, etc.
- **Virtual Token**: mio's - mod.io's Virtual Token Currency which underpins your studios currency (which may have a vanity title).

When it comes to implementing monetization features provided by mod.io, there is an important decision your studio must make as to who is processing the platform entitlements and their subsequent transactions with mod.io.
