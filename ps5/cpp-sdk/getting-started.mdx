## Installing the PlayStation&reg;5 Platform Modules

To use the mod.io PS5&reg; SDK integration, you need to copy the "prospero" directory into the platform subdirectory of your SDK installation.
You can then target PROSPERO to compile the mod.io SDK for PS5 SDK.

## PS5 SDK Versions

The mod.io SDK is built and tested against PS5 SDK version 8.00. Using different versions of the PS5 SDK may result in compilation issues.

In case you plan to use CMake to compile the mod.io SDK build outside of Visual Studio, you will need to install the "CMake Extensions", a file typically found here:

```cmake
C:\Program Files (x86)\SCE\PROSPERO\Tools\CMake Extensions\CMakeExtensionsForPS5-6_00_0_1.msi
```

Those extensions contain the relevant metadata used by CMake to find the Prospero compiler and libraries. The CMake FlagTables file is located at `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Preview\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\share\cmake-3.26\Templates\MSBuild\FlagTables` (or equivalent VS and CMake installation directory)

## Initializing the mod.io SDK

You should also ensure that you are passing Modio::Portal::PSN to InitialiazeAsync's PortalInUse property. This adds support for PlayStation Network usernames for linked accounts to be returned when querying mods, as well as respecting PlayStation Network account blocking rules, which is a certification requirement when displaying UGC.

### Setting the appropriate PlayStation&trade;Network Environment parameter

Playstation has 3 different environments that are used for authentication, purchases and other functionality. If you wish to use a different NP environment than the default production environment (256), please specify this as the 'PlatformEnvironment' parameter in the ExtendedParameters field on the parameters you provide when initializing the SDK.

You can do this by using the `IssuerId` parameter from `sceNpAuthGetAuthorizationCodeV3(ReqId, &AuthParam, &ResultAuthCode, &IssuerId);`. This will ensure that you will always be using the environment that auth was performed to automatically.

```cpp
auto Params = Modio::InitializeOptions(Modio::GameID(LaunchParams.GameId), Modio::ApiKey(LaunchParams.ApiKey), Modio::Environment::Live, Modio::Portal::PSN, "PSNUsername");

Params.ExtendedParameters["PlatformEnvironment"] = std::to_string(IssuerId);
```

## Mounting the Temp Data Directory

In your PS5 platform implementation, make sure that you are correctly mounting the temporary data area

```
SceAppContentTemporaryDataOption option = SCE_APP_CONTENT_TEMPORARY_DATA_OPTION_NONE;
SceAppContentMountPoint mountPoint;

sceAppContentTemporaryDataMount2(option, &mountPoint);
```

You should also ensure that you are passing Modio::Portal::PSN to InitialiazeAsync's PortalInUse property. This adds support for PlayStation Network usernames for linked accounts to be returned when querying mods, as well as respecting PlayStation Network account blocking rules, which is a certification requirement when displaying UGC.

## File System Restrictions

The maximum directory depth is 32 levels. 

## Authentication

There is a code authenticate example in located at `platform/prospero/examples/PSN` that guides you through the process of using `NPAuth` library. In case you need more details, search the topic "Authentication and Authorization" in the PS5 documentation.
