# Getting Started

Starting your journey with [mod.io](https://mod.io) is easy. In just a few simple steps you’ll be able to offer your players a seamless, cross-platform UGC experience.

## 1. Add Your Game

Add your game by clicking the “Getting Started” button on the [mod.io homepage](https://mod.io). If you’ve never used mod.io before, you’ll be prompted to create an account. 

:::tip
Game ownership can be transferred at any time, don’t worry about who creates your game profile.

Follow the prompts to set up your game’s profile. All information can be edited later on, so unannounced titles are free to use a code name during development. We recommend using our preview settings to hide your game until launch. If your title is already released and you require a separate, private environment, you can set up a new, hidden game profile for testing purposes. 

After you’ve added your game, set its content and moderation rules, such as whether you want to restrict mature content or not. 

:::tip
You can change these rules at any time from your game’s admin page.

## 2. Integrate mod.io 

First, you’ll need your API key, you can find it in the “API” section of your game’s admin page. Once you have your key, there are three primary methods of integrating mod.io into your game. 

### Unreal Engine and Unity Plugins

Our dedicated engine-plugins are the simplest way to implement mod.io in your [Unreal](/unreal) or [Unity](/unity) game. Alongside enabling streamlined use of all of mod.io’s features, both solutions also include an optional, robust, drop-in UGC browser UI.

### C++ SDK

If your game uses a custom engine, our full-featured [C++ SDK](/cppsdk) provides a fast and efficient solution for integrating mod.io. Just like our Unreal and Unity plugins, the C++ SDK also includes a powerful file management system that can automatically download and update players’ subscribed UGC files across all platforms.

### REST API

Web-apps or games that require atomic control over their mod.io implementation are free to access our [REST API](/restapiref/#getting-started) directly. The REST API powers both of our official plugins, as well as the C++ SDK. Which means that all of mod.io’s features are available, to help create your ideal custom implementation.

## 3. Enable Cross-Platform UGC

mod.io is an authorized middleware provider for PlayStation&reg;4 & PlayStation&reg;5, Xbox and Switch. We offer [full support and compliance with certification](/platforms), native SDKs and single sign-on. mod.io enables seamless, cross-platform UGC, and helps your creators to reach their audience across PC, consoles and mobile.

To get started, speak to your platform account managers about adding mod.io and UGC to your game. You can also reach out to us directly, where we can introduce you to our dedicated account managers who are experienced in (and enthusiastic about) [mod.io](https://mod.io) and UGC.
