# Monetization

The inclusion of UGC in your game can create opportunities to generate revenue for your studio and for content creators. Marketplace is our monetization solution for buying and selling premium UGC, and we currently have more monetization options in the works.

## Marketplace

mod.io provides a complete end-to-end UGC monetization solution with [Marketplace](/monetization/marketplace) integration for your game. It supports everything from web-based transactions to in-game purchases.

## Partner Program

The [Partner Program](/monetization/partner) is an optional system that provides the ability to vet content creators who wish to monetize their UGC creations.

## Purchase servers

[Purchase Servers](/monetization/purchase-servers) are required if you are selling content (either [virtual currency packs](/monetization/how-it-works), or USD priced premium UGC) through a platform store, as you will need a service to consume the entitlements and apply them to players mod.io accounts. You can either set one up via mod.io or your game studio.

## Future Monetization

UGC offers a variety of monetization opportunities for studios and we are currently exploring a suite of extra monetization options such as patronage donations and engagement payments.
