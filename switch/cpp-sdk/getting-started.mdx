## Installing the Switch Platform Modules

To use the mod.io Switch integration, you need to copy the nx directory into the platform subdirectory of your SDK installation.
You can then target NX to compile the mod.io SDK for Switch.


## Switch SDK Versions

The mod.io SDK is built and tested against Switch SDK version 16.2.0. Using different versions of the Switch SDK may result in compilation issues.

## Initializing the mod.io SDK

You should also ensure that you are passing Modio::Portal::Switch to InitializeAsync’s PortalInUse property. This adds support for Switch Online usernames for linked accounts to be returned when querying mods, which is a certification requirement when displaying UGC.

# Using the Switch Module

When setting up Switch as a platform, you need to ensure that you have set up Cache and Temporary data storage in your application’s nmeta file. We recommend the following values:

```
&lt;CacheStorageSize>0x40000000&lt;/CacheStorageSize>
&lt;CacheStorageJournalSize>0x64000000&lt;/CacheStorageJournalSize>
&lt;TemporaryStorageSize>0x0000000010000000&lt;/TemporaryStorageSize>
```

In your Switch platform implementation, make sure that you are correctly mounting the two storage points, replacing the mount names appropriately

```
nn::fs::MountCacheStorage("modio");
nn::fs::MountTemporaryStorage("temp");
```

Once these are set up, you need to initialize the mod.io SDK with the names of the mount points that you wish to use for your application. Use a Modio::InitializeOptions to intialize the SDK, and include the following extended properties, replacing your mount names appropriately

```
Opts.ExtendedParameters["CommonMountPoint"] = "modio";
Opts.ExtendedParameters["TempMountPoint"] = "temp";	
```

Note that the function `Modio::GetDefaultModInstallationDirectory()` is designed to return a consisent default path independent of intialization status. Therefore, when using `Modio::GetDefaultModInstallationDirectory()` on Switch, the string returned will not include the `CommonMountPoint` prefix. You must add this manually.
