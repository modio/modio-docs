# Nintendo Switch

Typical Nintendo Switch requirements include:
* UGC cannot run scripts or execute code, unless sufficient mitigations are demonstrated to be in place (e.g. sandboxing or manual curation of content)
* Nintendo prefers that UGC is called “UGC”, “Items”, “Content”, “Maps” or something similar, not "Mods"
* UGC must work without the need for manual installation
* If content is created by a Nintendo user, the display name of the Nintendo user must be shown as the creator if available (our system does this automatically if you configure your [platform headers correctly](/restapiref/#platforms))
* User consent is required the first time before authenticating a Nintendo user
* If the Nintendo user has UGC parental controls disabled, the UGC menu and any UGC installed must be disabled

All games supporting UGC must be approved individually, and you will be required to go through a dedicated UGC approval process with Nintendo directly once you are ready to launch the functionality. We recommend contacting your Nintendo representative early to establish their rules for UGC and any specific requirements you will need to meet. We can assist you with this process, and introduce you to our contact Ulysse Richert-Botté (Developer Relations, Nintendo) if this would be helpful.

## SDK Access

For Nintendo Switch access, use the verification link at the bottom of this page: [https://developer.nintendo.com/group/development/getting-started/g1kr9vj6/middleware/mod.io](https://developer.nintendo.com/group/development/getting-started/g1kr9vj6/middleware/mod.io)

Once verified, notify your mod.io contact and we will provide access to the Nintendo Switch support module for your integration solution. Alternatively, contact us directly at developers@mod.io.

## Moderation

Only UGC which follows the rules should be made available to download and play. Also as the most resource constrained platform, often you will find not all content can run on the Switch. Our moderation tools and web dashboard allow you to control this process and manage the types of UGC available on the Nintendo Platform without any additional development required.

## Authentication

On Nintendo platforms, you can authenticate the user with mod.io using their email address, or you can authenticate the user with Nintendo Network ID authentication. Our developers are available to assist and advise on the best implementation: developers@mod.io

:::note
We do not currently support login via Nintendo on the mod.io site. Users who are authenticated using a Nintendo Network ID will be limited to only the in-game experience. As such we recommend using Nintendo Network ID authentication where a full in-game integration has been implemented. We are currently negotiating with Nintendo to support authentication on mod.io website with Nintendo Network ID in a future update.

## Consent

If you choose to use Nintendo Network ID authentication (this isn’t required for email), you are required to collect the user's consent before they are authenticated for the first time. So when a user clicks the “UGC” button in-game, you must display an [acceptance dialog](/terms).

## Networking & Storage

Storage space available for UGC will be limited, and allocation for space dedicated to UGC will require approval from Nintendo, who will require you to manage a strict data budget. In addition to the aforementioned approval, cache storage and temp storage will require an entry in your NMETA file. All games that implement mod.io services will require space for storing cached and downloaded data.
