# Component UI

Component UI is the backbone of any in-game UI built in our [Unreal Engine](/unreal) and [Unity](/unity) plugins. This framework allows you to customize your in-game UI to match your game or brand's signature style.

## Modular UI framework 

The Component UI framework is made up of a set of specifications, UI components, and editor tooling that allow you to rapidly integrate mod.io plugin data and events into your game's UI, either directly into existing screens or in dedicated browser and discovery sections.

*Example: Component UI was used in Mix Universe to present UGC as a series of planets on a galaxy map.*
